**
** Many thanks to bscuderi13 for all of the guidance.
**
** This Particle sketch integrates a Particle (Photon in my case) with a 
** Relay Shield with SmartThings.
**
** WebCoRE is used to refresh the state of the garage doors in SmartThings 
** on a particle.publish from the garage state logic in the loop. 
**
** After all this, integration with Google and Alexa via IFTTT is trivial.
**
** The Particle Relay Shield uses D3-D6 to control the relays, but we're only 
** using D3-D5.  You could add another if you have four doors.
**
** We have a LED installed in our bedroom that flashes if a door is open.  The wire loves it. 
** Thanks to a fancy RGB common cathode(-) LEDs, it will flash R for garage 1, G for garage 2,
** and B for garage 3 if it's open.  I used pins A4, A5, and A7 (WKP) because they each go from 0 to 255.
** Other analog pins went up to 4000-something.  There was some reason for this.  The common goes to ground.
**
** GarageRelay commands are:
**  - "1" -- toggle garage 1
**  - "2" -- toggle garage 2
**  - "3" -- toggle garage 3
**  - "open1" -- open garage 1 only if it's currently closed
**  - "close1" -- close garage 1 only if it's currently open
**  - "open2" -- open garage 2 only if it's currently closed
**  - "close2" -- close garage 2 only if it's currently open
**  - "open3" -- open garage 3 only if it's currently closed
**  - "close3" -- close garage 3 only if it's currently open
**  - "openAll" -- trigger all doors only if they're closed
**  - "closeAll" -- trigger all doors only if they're open
